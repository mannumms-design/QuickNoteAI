ChatGPT/Copilot are general-purpose AI tools. QuickNoteAI is a context-aware personal knowledge tool.
Example-
1. Student writes: Daily lecture notes and clicks “Weekly Summary”.
   AI generates: Key concepts, Important formulas, Exam-focused highlights

2. Developer stores: Meeting notes
   AI generates: Action items, Follow-ups, Technical summaries
